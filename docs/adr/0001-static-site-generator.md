# Static site generator

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Reg Meyer
* Date: 27 July 2018

Technical Story: https://github.com/NandosUK/malariathon/issues/5

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to have a static site generated and need to decide on which framework to use. The considerations are more founded in whether to use react or vue and what is the current comfort level of the contributors.

## Decision Drivers

* Contributor skillset
* Modern framework that is easy to deploy

## Considered Options

* Gatsby
* Nuxt

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Gatsby**, because most of the contributors are comfortable with using React and therefore Gatsby. It is also easy to deploy using Netlify and other tools.
